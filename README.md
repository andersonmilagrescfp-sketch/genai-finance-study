# AI Study Companion – Inflation & Real Interest Rates

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the Bradesco GenAI & Data program.

## Target audience
Investors and finance beginners who want a practical understanding of inflation, real interest rates, and how these concepts affect returns in fixed income and everyday decisions (e.g., financing vs investing).

## What you will find here
- Practical explanations with numeric examples
- Prompt library for NotebookLM to support active learning and revision
- A mini study guide and glossary based on curated sources
- Notes on limitations and common mistakes when using AI for finance

The objective is to use AI (NotebookLM) as a structured learning tool to explore introductory financial concepts related to inflation and real interest rates.

The project emphasizes:
- Critical thinking
- Source curation
- Prompt experimentation
- Validation of AI-generated responses
