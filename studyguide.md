# Mini Study Guide — Inflation & Real Interest Rates (Practical)

## 1) Core idea (one-liner)
Real return is what remains after discounting inflation.

## 2) Key concepts
- **Nominal rate:** the “headline” rate.
- **Inflation:** price level change over time.
- **Real rate:** purchasing power gain after inflation.

## 3) The real interest rate formula
(1 + real) = (1 + nominal) / (1 + inflation)

## 4) Practical examples
### Example 1 — Investment return
If an investment yields 12% per year and inflation is 6%:
Real ≈ (1.12 / 1.06) - 1 ≈ 5.66%

### Example 2 — Financing vs investing (intuition)
A loan at 11% nominal can be “less expensive” if inflation is high and your investments yield higher real returns.
But you must compare:
- cost of debt (after taxes/fees)
- investment return (net of taxes/fees)
- liquidity and risk

## 5) Common mistakes
- Comparing nominal returns with real costs
- Ignoring fees and taxes
- Using “average inflation” without context

## 6) Quick checklist
- What is the nominal rate?
- What is the inflation measure used?
- Are fees/taxes included?
- What’s the real result?
