# Reflections (AI + Finance)

## What worked well
- When prompts asked for numeric examples, answers became clearer and more useful.
- Requests for citations helped verify claims and avoid hallucinations.

## What can go wrong
- AI may oversimplify or mix indices (IPCA vs IGP-M) without context.
- It may omit taxes/fees, which changes real-world conclusions.

## My rule of use
AI is used for structure and synthesis, not as a primary source.
All conclusions must be checked against the curated references.
